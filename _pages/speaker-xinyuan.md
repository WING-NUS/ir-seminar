## Psychology-based Recommendation Systems

Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems have become increasingly important in people’s everyday life. In the era of big data, most recommendation systems today are data-driven and based on analyzing user’s behavioral data. While such systems can produce useful recommendations, existing models rarely investigate the psychological factors behind user’s behavior, such as user’s personality and emotion. In this talk, we first introduce the research motivation, the current challenges of psychology-based recommendation systems. Besides, we introduce our preliminary work that explored the effectiveness of personality in current recommendation systems. Based on these preliminary research exploration, we finally introduce our thoughts and discussion.
